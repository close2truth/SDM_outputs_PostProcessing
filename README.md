# SDM_outputs_PostProcessing
The post-processing program for the output results of fault slip distribution by SDM inversion, including drawing of residual histogram, slip distribution, and data fitting.
## requirement:
matlab 2018 and above.
## Usage:
The main files for this library contain：
1) interp_def.m: Interpolate the predicted deformations, calculate residuals and generate grd files for GMT plotting.
2) plot_disp.m: Plot the fault slip distribution, containing total slip, dip- and strike-slip components.
3) residue_his.m: Draw residue histogram, in order to analysis the distribution of residue.
